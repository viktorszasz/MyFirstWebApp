<h1> Sperm whale gets tangled up in ghost nets in Scotland</h1>

  <h2>What happened in Scotland?</h2>
  <p>A sperm whale which died on Monday after washing up on the island of Raasay had been entangled in ropes.
It was the latest in a series of whale entanglements off the Scottish coast in the last few months.</p>
<p>The 15m-long (49ft) sperm whale was spotted off Skye last Thursday.
It was entangled in ropes, some of them trailing up to 20m (66ft) behind it.
Volunteers from wildlife charity British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) managed to reach the whale in a small boat on Saturday.
They successfully freed it of five ropes, but others remained wrapped around its head.
On Monday, the whale was discovered stranded on the shoreline near Oskaig, on Raasay, a small island off Skye's east coast.
BDMLR said a rope was found tightly wrapped around the whale's mouth.
It said this would have prevented it from feeding and it was likely to have been malnourished for some time.
Sperm whales are a deep-diving species and prey on large squid.
BDMLR had hoped that, once free of all the remaining ropes, the whale would refloat on a rising tide. But it died later on Monday..</p>

  <h2>Can entanglements be prevented?</h2>
  <p>The entanglement alliance has been working with the inshore fishing industry for a number of years to raise awareness. It encourages people in the industry to report incidents and to find out how they might be able to assist in disentanglements through workshops.</p>
